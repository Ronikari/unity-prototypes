## Unity Prototypes

This repository contains some of my game prototypes created and modified as a result of studying the excellent book *"Introduction to Game Design, Prototyping, and Development"* by Jeremy Gibson Bond and completing the *Unity Junior Programmer* course on Unity Learn.

## Contents

* **Apple Picker** : a very simple project when you have to catch apples and dodge bombs by moving the basket. The more apples you catch, the more often they will fall. If you catch the bomb or miss 3 apples, the game will over.
* **Mission Demolition** : this project is inspired by the mechanics of *Angry Birds*. Use a slingshot to fire projectiles at a castle, hoping to demolish it. Each castle has a goal area (green) that the projectile must touch to continue to the next level.
* **Space SHMUP** : a classic space-based SHMUP when you control the ship (press WASD to move and Space to shoot) and fight against enemy ships. Also you can pick some upgrates (S - shield, B - blaster, T - turrent, S - spread blaster).
* **Prospector Solitaire** : a variation of the *Tri-Peaks Solitaire* game. In this prototype you should remove all cards from the tableau – you may move any card that is either exactly one rank above or one rank below the target card from the tableau onto the target card, making it the new targer card. If none of the face-up cards can be played on the target card, draw a new target card from the draw pile. Moving a card from the tableau to the target card earns 1 point (second card in a chain earns 2 points, etc). The number of points earned for a run will double for each special gold card in the run. Also you can use some features: *Bomb* – to destroy any pick-up card on the tableau, *Make Gold* – turn any pick-up card into a golden card, *Undo* – to return previous move.
* **Street Runner** : a very-very simple side-scroll runner. Press Space to jump, press twice to double jump).
* **Steel Balls** : in this project you control a steel ball on the hexagon field (press WS to move and AD to rotate the field/camera) and dash enemy balls outside the field. The round ends when you throw off all enemy balls from the field. There are several types of enemies: white – common ball, can move and dash you too; blue – heavy ball, hard to dash him; big red – he appears every 5th round and can be heavy, launch projectiles or summon balls. Also you can pick up some bonuses: yellow gem – more efficient dash; red gem – to launch projectiles at all enemies in the field; green gem – shock wave (press Space to jump).

*NOTE: Street Runner and Steel Balls prototypes don't yet have a GUI. Please reopen the window to restart.*
